```{r data}
fn <- "data-01.csv"
a <- 0
b <- sample(c(-1, 1), 1) * sample(c(0, 0.6, 0.9), 1)
dat <- data.frame(x = runif(200, -1, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(y = a + b * x + rnorm(n(), 0, 0.25)) %>% 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~round(.x, 2)))
write.csv(dat, fn, row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

fit <- lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
bhats <- round(coef(fit), 4)
bpvl <- summary(fit)$coefficients[2, 4]
bsol <- c(bpvl >= 0.05, (bpvl < 0.05) & (bhats[2] > 0), (bpvl < 0.05) & (bhats[2] < 0))

opts <- c("`x` and `y` are not significantly correlated",
          "`y` increases significantly with `x`",
          "`y` decreases significantly with `x`")
```   


Using the data provided in [`r fn`](`r fn`) estimate a linear regression of
`y` on `x` and answer the following questions. _**For numerical answers, write your answer to 4 decimal places.**_

a) Which of the statement is true? `cloze schoice(opts, opts[bsol])`
b) What is the least squares estimate of the **intercept**? `cloze bhats[1]`
c) What is the least squares estimate of the **slope**? `cloze bhats[2]`
d) What is the **correlation** of `x` and `y`? `cloze round(cor(dat$x, dat$y), 4)`

To replicate the analysis in R:

```r
dat <- read.csv("`r fn`")
fit <- lm(y ~ x, data = dat)
summary(fit)
```

It is also always good practice to visualise the data:

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) +
 geom_point() + 
 geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
