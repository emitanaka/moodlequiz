The `moodlequiz` R package is an alternative interface to produce the Moodle XML files via the `exams` package. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of moodlequiz like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("emitanaka/moodlequiz")
```

## Example

Below is a Moodle quiz where the students have to select the right variables from the data to map onto the plot aesthetics in `ggplot2`.

The above quiz is created from the R Markdown document below. Knitting the document below will generate 5 different versions of the quiz where the x, y, color, and size are mapped randomly to one of the variables in the `mtcars` data. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
cat("````\n")
cat(readLines("inst/examples/draw-scatterplots.Rmd"), sep = "\n")
cat("````")
```
